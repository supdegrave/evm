* new migrations
  - insert existing functions from `2013 Leads List spreadsheet`? 
  
* clear modal error display on any close of dialog, not just from [Add] / [Cancel]
  - there's probably ondocumentready functionality similar to jQuery 

* custom event? : call appendRoles on element ready or changed rather than explictly 

admin.js.coffee
* dynamically bind modal clicker on new user add
* Update functions / roles lists when new items are added
  - push functions and roles into AdminData, bind selects 
* move hard-coded ["admin", "Board Member"] to external js file to allow configuration
  - js file should simply assign an array of strings to variable
  - update selRole.change handler to set that variable to [] if null / undefined
  - alternately, update Role to include "core_roles" bit
    - then change application.yml to have CORE_ROLES and FUNCTION_ROLES

app/views/admin/index.html.haml:
* add error-handling display for Users, Functions, Roles 
* determine why having multiple input fields blocks submit-on-return (email/first_name/last_name)
* background highlight for admin and Board Member - doesn't work on Chrome

app/views/functions/_admin_edit.html.haml:
* uncomment delete link when ready to wire up ajax return 
* figure out why destroy_role_path is missing from routes
* convert 'Delete User' to icon, with remote method call

config/routes.rb:
* it would be deeply useful to grok this completely: http://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html
* resourcify admin routes. I think that means changing #invitation to #create 

spec/features/admin_actions_spec.rb:
* look into webkit driver rather than selenium 

spec/features/admin_actions_spec.rb:
* figure out why ajax update isn't working in selenium 

admin_controller.rb
* Don't require password to edit account

# ##### SQL TO CLEAR ROLES #####
